<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
In this project, we implemented a realistic cloth simulator and several shaders for stylization. The cloth simulator is powered by mechanical physics equations and a cloth data structure. The cloth is modeled as a two-dimensional grid of points that 
are connected by a lattice of springs. The simulated motion of each point mass is based on the cumulative effects of external forces like gravity and Hooke's law-obeying spring forces and is calculated using Verlet integration. While the technique isn't perfect, 
the results are relatively stable and realistic. The cloth simulation also accounts for collisions with scene objects and with itself to prevent any clipping/phasing that the cloth may have experienced without them. Shaders were interesting in general to 
implement, and they allowed for much creative freedom when it came to the appearance of the cloth simulation and the environment it interacts with. We did take a while to debug the actual physics portion of the project, namely why the cloth wasn't responding 
to any forces it was subjected to, but once we got that working, the rest was rather smooth sailing.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>
<p>
The cloth is a row-major lattice of point masses tied together by three types of springs: structural, shearing, and bending springs. Structural springs were placed between cardinally adjacent points, shearing springs were placed between diagonally adjacent 
points, and bending springs were placed between every other cardinal point (such that points on the same row/column separated by one point had a bending spring between them). The first two types of springs resist stretching and compressing forces within the 
cloth plane, while the third type of spring resists deformational forces in the out-of-plane direction. The images below display the spring structure that link the point masses of the cloth together.

<h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
<p>
Verlet integration is central to this simulation because it calculates the new positions of the point masses for each timestep using the forces each point mass is subjected to. In this case, the forces in play are gravity and the internal spring forces of the 
cloth. Three tunable parameters affect the simulation: the spring constant, the density, and the damping. The spring constant changes the stiffness of the springs and how much force they exert on the point masses when stretched. Density changes the mass of the 
cloth, which changes the forces of gravity on the point masses. Damping changes the amount of energy that is lost when a spring stretches or compresses. Beyond these three parameters, an extra constraint is placed on the springs, namely that the springs cannot 
stretch to a length longer than 110% of its resting length. For structural, shearing, and bending springs, the limits are $1.1L$, $1.1\sqrt{2}L$, and $2.2L$, where $L$ is the distance between cardinally adjacent point masses. The images below show the effects 
of the three tunable parameters on the cloth simulation, specifically one where a square cloth is pinned on two corners and allowed to fall from a horizontal position.
</p>

<h3 align="left">Spring Constant</h3>
<p>
The following three images show the spring constant at 500 N/m, 5000 N/m, and 50000 N/m. As can be seen, the higher the spring constant, the flatter the cloth. This is because the lower spring constant allows for gravity to more strongly affect each point mass, 
while the higher spring constant does the opposite.
</p>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<h3 align="left">Density</h3>
<p>
Increasing density intensifies the forces of gravity on each point mass, allowing for greater deformation in the case of high density. This is because the forces of gravity are directly related to the mass of each point mass ($F=ma$), which can then directly 
counteract the spring forces that resist such deformation.

    </tbody>

</div>

<h3 align="left">Damping</h3>
<p>
While changing the damping value (usually) has no direct effect on the final resting position of the cloth, it changes how quickly the cloth gets to that final resting position. The reason we say "usually" is that, with 0% damping, the cloth never reaches a 
resting position and continues to wiggle about ever so slightly due to having no energy loss. While this is difficult to show in image form, it is made evident with the slight ripples in the cloth (that may not themselves be so evident).

<h2 align="middle">Part III: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
<p>
  While all three pictures show collision of the cloth with the ball, with a low spring constant ($k_s = 500 N/m$), we see that the cloth is more "droopy" since the springs do not have enough strength to combat gravity at resting state. As we increase $k_s$, 
  we see that the cloth stiffens up and doesn't drape over the ball as much, which makes sense since the springs - consider bending for easy visualization - are now more exerting more force ($k_s = 5000 N/m$). With $k_s = 50000$, we see that the cloth act more like a stiff wet cardboard than a cloth, 
  since the all the springs are now extremely stiff and exert a lot more force.

<h2 align="middle">Part IV: Handling self-collisions</h2>
<p>
  The procedure for detecting self-collision is as follows:
  <ol>
    <li>Divide 3D space into a volumetric grid and place each point mass into a bin. Perform checks for self-intersection in each bin. The hash of each bin is determined using the following formula:
      $$\textrm{hash} = \frac{(c+z+1)(c+z)}{2}+z,\textrm{ where }c=\frac{(x+y+1)(x+y)}{2}+y.$$
      This allows for a unique hash for each coordinate (this is an example of a nested Cantor pairing function).
    </li>
    <li>Within each bin, collision is then checked, and corrections applied.</li>
  </ol>
  This method allows for much better performance, as collision checks are no longer being performed across world space.<br /><br />Below are some images that display the cloth in three different stages of self-collision.
</p>
<div align="middle">

      <tr align="center">

</div>

<p>
  The following pictures shows comparison of high $k_s$, low $k_s$, high density, low density and their effects on self-collision. One thing to remark is that, just like the previous part, low density and high ks behave very similarly, because the F=ma, and when density goes up, so does the force. This means that the forces are relatively larger than the resistive forces of the springs, causing really tight folds from the springs which slowly spreads out a little. For High $k_s$ and low density, the forces are relatively small compared to the resistive forces of the springs, hence we see much wider, smoother folds that spreads out quickly.

<h2 align="middle">Part V: Shaders</h2>

<p>
  Shaders offer a more efficient alternative to rendering realistic material appearances without necessitating exhaustive ray tracing. GLSL shaders are comprised of a vertex and fragment shader, the first of which transforms scene-space fields into normalized 
  screen-space coordinates, and the second of which assigns an RGBA vector for each pixel in screen space using the interpolated screen-space coordinates.
</p>

<h3 align="left">Blinn-Phong Shading</h3>
<p>
  The Blinn-Phong shading model is an approximation model that combines three different types of shading: ambient light, diffuse light, and specular reflections. Ambient light is the intensity of light reflecting uniformly off of and onto every object in the 
  scene. Diffuse light is the function of the normal relative to the light source utilizing Lambert's cosine law (i.e. the smaller the angle between the normal and the light source, the brighter the illumination). Specular reflection uses the light source 
  position, the normal, and the camera position to calculate realistic reflections that glossy material would produce. The images below display each component of Blinn-Phong shading and the result of combining all three.<br /><br />As an aside, it is possible to 
  adjust the effect each component has by changing the weights for each kind of lighting (defined within our code as <code>ka</code>, <code>kd</code>, and <code>ks</code>, respectively).

</div>

<p>
  Bump mapping attempts to emulate displacement mapping by adjusting the color values for each pixel based on what the displacement should have been (by modifying surface normals for color calculation), while displacement mapping actually changes the geometry of 
  the texture. So, while bump mapping is more efficient, it will generally not be as realistic as displacement mapping. Bump mapping is actually better on low resolution geometry, because displacement mapping doesn't have enough vertices to work with, causing 
  jagged and inaccurate (although correct) approximations of the displacements.

<p>
  Notice how the displacement on low resolution without sufficient geometry to reflect the height map makes the sphere really lumpy, emphasizing the low polygon of the underlying mesh. So for low-polygon scenarios, bump mapping only may actually be better.
